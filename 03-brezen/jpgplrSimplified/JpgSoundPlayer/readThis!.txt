Experimental application producing
a midi synthesis signal from a picture
source of any standart extensions.

quickHelp:

TO PLAY THE IMAGES DRAG AND
DROP THEM ON AN APP SCREEN

(you can also directly drag the pictures
from your webBrowser etc.)

Beware of using images with
dimmensions greather than 
2048 pix in X or Y:
causes program crash at most
of cases.

Tested only on the winXp

program won't run:

Program will use the first device
logged as an midi device.
In most cases its "Microsoft midimapper"
It is supported by AC 97 standarted
soundcards.

JVM 1.4.2+ must be installed on your
computer before running app.

Uses JOGL renderer 1.1
-that means you have to have an
OPENGL supported graphics card.

If experiencing some problems
or have any suggestions..
